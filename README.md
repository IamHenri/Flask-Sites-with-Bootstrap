# Flask-Sites-with-Bootstrap

Some sets of scripts to build sites with Flask and Bootstrap. For every directory you'll download / clone / copy or whatever, you have to run these two commands to run your site : 

export FLASK_APP=app.py

flask run

visit https://127.0.0.1:5000 and be amazed. 

# First directory 

01 - One page bootstrap - Contains twwo file : index.html in the templates directory and the app.py. 

Dowload the content if '01 - One page bootstrap' and in a terminal execute commands above. 

The simplest Bootstrap page with Flask. 

# Second directory 

This second directory lets you use a web site with several pages. A big step has been made. (yet to be done)
